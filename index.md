# Beginning of Site
This is some example text to see what things are actually looking like on the published site. I've never worked on anything like this before, so specifically I'm looking to investiagte:
1. How does Markdown ultimately render on the built site.
2. Do things like *italics* **bold** and ~~other types of text~~ work in numbered lists, for example.
3. Just overall what's the workflow here like.

## Other Notes
I'm hoping this isn't too different from working with Github Wikis lmao those are really easy to use and work with. Also hoping I don't have to get too deep into like proper webdev stuff for this (although to be fair this would be a good excuse to finally do so lol). Provided this is meaningfully different from Wiki stuff though, maybe it'll open up some freedom to some fancier looking stuff then? Interactable elements at some point could be cool maybe lol.
